## About The Project

BookMart is a responsive web application that serves as an online platform for managing book-related operations. This project is built with a versatile tech stack including HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React.js, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js.

### Key Features

- **API Management with Postman:** MyGoals uses Postman to provide an intuitive interface for managing its APIs. This makes it easy to interact with the backend services and perform CRUD operations on user goals.

- **JWT Authentication and Authorization:** The project implements robust security using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication and authorization. Bearer tokens ensure secure access control, protecting user data and resources.

- **MongoDB for User Credentials:** User credentials, including goal information, are stored securely in a MongoDB database. Proper security measures are in place to safeguard sensitive data.
